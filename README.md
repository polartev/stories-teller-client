AI-powered cross-platform application that generates text descriptions for user-uploaded photos.

This project consists of three main parts:
- **Cross-platform client app** (built with .NET MAUI)
- **Server** (FastAPI running on lightweight VPS)
- **Admin desktop tool** (Python)

> Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project. The goal: to provide users with meaningful text stories based on their photos, using AI generation.

## ‚ú® Latest Update: Global update of user-app, server, and admin parts
_This_ update was targeted at developing an app in all directions. Future updates will enhance today's results.

### ‚úÖ Added library page
On this page, users can view, edit, and open all generated stories.

![Library](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a495cdf-3f23-471c-afeb-22381e0523dd)

Clicking the edit button opens a pop-up window:

![Edit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837fc5a8-af19-404b-aa55-959cf96292ed)

- Deleting history will erase the story and all associated photos.
- Editing allows renaming the story.
